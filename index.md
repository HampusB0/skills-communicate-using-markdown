# The Greatest Header The World Has Ever Seen!
Quite the amazing work has been put into this header you should really feel honored to be in the preasence of such a phenomenon.
### In other news, the world is on fire. Quite the problem indeed
As stated above, the world is quite literaly on fire. This really is not the ideal scenario to be sure. 
###### Puni header, not even worth discussing at any lenght at all. 

Is this supposed to be the commit message i'm supposed to write? If so, here is the message: A great header and message has been written and added to this md file. Not at all redundant, very important.

Text is no longer at the bottom, sad. Anyways, here is a picture instead.

I hope you liked it.

Here are code snippets, should be fixed:
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```

Other, please work:
``` java
String mystr = "Hello everyone! I shall start counting!";
for(int i=0; i < 10; i++){
  System.out.println("This number is: " + i);
}

```
